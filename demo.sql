-- Get the first and last name of every player in the database.
-- Note: this is a code comment in SQL (meaning it's documentation and ignored by the computer).
-- My comment: command / will make new comments or toggle it on/off
-- Much easier to make changes to up in the top section (plus you keep version control, versus the terminal but it executes all the same)
